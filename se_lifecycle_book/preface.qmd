# Preface

This book grew from years of teaching software engineering, guiding project teams, and developing industry-aligned academic curricula.

The goal is simple:

**To teach software engineering not as theory, but as a practical craft.**

Throughout this book, you will build a complete software project, from concept to deployment, mirroring the processes used by professional engineers.

This is a living OER resource, continuously evolving, and contributions are welcome.
