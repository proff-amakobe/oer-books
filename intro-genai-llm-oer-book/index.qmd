# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Introduction to Generative AI with Large Language Models*!\
This Open Educational Resource (OER) is designed for graduate students and practitioners who want to **build real, production-minded GenAI applications**, not just learn the theory.

Across the chapters, you will progressively build intelligent systems using: - Prompt engineering and evaluation - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines - API integration patterns and DevOps practices - Multimodal tools and workflows - Safety, ethics, and responsible deployment

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped how software teams build interfaces, automate knowledge work, and deliver user-facing intelligence.\
This book provides a practical, engineering-first pathway from fundamentals to production deployment, with hands-on milestones in every chapter.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this book, you will be able to: - Explain LLM concepts (tokens, embeddings, attention, transformers) and how they impact application design. - Design prompts, templates, and evaluation workflows for reliable, controllable outputs. - Build RAG systems with chunking, embeddings, vector search, and grounded generation with citations. - Integrate multiple model providers with retries, caching, observability, and cost controls. - Implement multimodal pipelines for images, documents, and audio. - Apply responsible AI practices (privacy, bias mitigation, safety controls, red-teaming). - Deploy and operate GenAI systems with CI/CD and production monitoring.
